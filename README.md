# My Tech Goal
A single-page website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Overview
This project demonstrates a simple single-page website that outlines my tech goals for the next two years, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This was one of the tasks given to me at [HNG](https://www.hng.tech/) Internship 11.

It features a responsive design, images with natural dimensions and a `data-test-id` attribute assigned to a number of required elements such as;
- My Slack Name
- My Slack Email
- My Slack Profile Picture
- Current Time in UTC
- Current Day of the week
- A link to [hng.tech/learn](https://hng.tech/learn)
- A link to [keyword.dog](https://keyword.dog/)
- A link to [scrapeanyweb.site](https://scrapeanyweb.site/)
